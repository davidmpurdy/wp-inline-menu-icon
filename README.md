# Inline Menu Icon

## A WordPress plugin to add inline SVG icons to menu titles

Adds a setting to each menu item to set an SVG icon and control its size and alignment. 

## Options:

* Icon
* Icon height (including CSS units)
* Alignment relative to the menu title (to the left of it, to the right of it, or replace it altogether)

## Other plugins
 * Requires [Advanced Custom Fields](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/)
 * Works well with [Safe SVG](https://wordpress.org/plugins/safe-svg/) (since SVG uploads must be allowed)
